In today’s world, technology plays a huge role in our lives, and one of the most important technologies is social media. Platforms such as Instagram, TikTok, and Twitter have changed our ways of communicating. While social media has many benefits, it also raises questions about its impact on our happiness, relationships, and personal growth. By taking a look at social media through the eyes of Aristotle’s philosophy, we can better understand its effects and how to use it wisely.
Aristotle is one of the most impactful philosophers from ancient Greece. He founded a school that emphasized virtue. His philosophy was rooted in understanding the natural world. If Aristotle were to look at the technological aspect of modern world, such as social media. He would evaluate it through ethics, human flourishing, and how is it shaping people’s life.
If Aristotle is still alive today, he would have mixed feelings about social media. On one hand, he is going to like how the connects of people are allows them to share ideas much easier. On the other hand, he would likely criticize how it can lead to bad habits and lower our self-esteem. Aristotle believed in finding a balance between extremes. However, on social media people would only post the best side of themselves, which is the best way to get likes, reviews and followers, this often make people pursuit “fake happiness”. They would go to have “fun” just to have something to post on social media, which defeats the purpose of having fun. Aristotle also valued deep friendships and believed that communities are important for a good life. Social media does helps people stay connected; it often focuses on quantity over quality. Online interactions are often shallow, some people might have hundreds of "friends" without really knowing any of them. Aristotle is going to argue that social media weakens real relationships and makes it harder to form honest connections.
Social media is a big part of my life. I use it to stay in touch with friends and catch up what is going on in the world. I only use WeChat to commutate with my friends and
sometime post something that I truly felt happy when I am doing it. However, there is one app that I think I am spending too much time on, Tik Tok. A lot of times, I spend too much time scrolling, and it distracts me from homework or other important things. I’ve also felt pressure to see all the "perfect" picture and compare myself to others, which can make me feel insecure. While social media is fun and helpful, it’s easy to get caught up in the negatives if I’m not being careful.
I pretty much agree with Aristotle’s perspective on social media. His idea of finding balance makes a lot of sense to me. Social media can be great when used in a right way, but it’s easy to overuse it and make it into a bad habit. Spending too much time on social media can make you feel jealous, insecure, and even become an addiction, which is going against Aristotle’s idea of living a balanced and virtuous life. I also agree with Aristotle’s thought on meaningful relationships. Even though social media helps me stay connected easier, but focusing on my online life could make me spend less time in real life. However, I don’t completely agree with Aristotle’s thoughts about technology. While he might see social media as a distraction, I think it can also be a great tool for something good. For example, social media can help people raise awareness about important issues, such as climate change or social justice. It can bring people together and create communities as well, some of them might even not exist without social media. I believe that if it is used responsibly, social media can for sure help people live a better life, even if it’s might not be exactly what Aristotle had in his mind.
Aristotle’s philosophy gives us a good way to think about social media and its impact on our lives. His ideas about balance, virtue, and meaningful relationships remind us to use social media responsibly and try to avoid the negativity that it brings. Even though social media can sometimes lead to bad habit, it can be a positive force as well. I agree with Aristotle’s idea of balance and his focus on real relationships, but I do

believe that social media has the potential to make the world better as well. The important thing is to use it thoughtfully and not let it take over our lives. By taking Aristotle’s advice, we can enjoy the benefits of social media and also living a happy and meaningful life.
